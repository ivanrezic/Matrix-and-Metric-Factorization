# Matrix-and-Metric-Factorization
In this repository you can find Matrix and Metric Factorizations implemented based on these two papers:

* Y. Koren, R. Bell and C. Volinsky, "Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems," in Computer, vol. 42, no. 8, pp. 30-37, Aug. 2009.
* Zhang, Shuai & Yao, Lina & Tay, Yi & Xu, Xiwei & Zhang, Xiang & Zhu, Liming. (2018). Metric Factorization: Recommendation beyond Matrix Factorization. 

Dataset used is: [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

Please note: these two implementations are offered without hyperparameter tuning and are prone to some noob TensorFlow mistakes.
